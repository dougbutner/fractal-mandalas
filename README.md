# The wisdom of fractals.. 

..is expressed in the structure of life, light, and the universe itself. 

Sacred geometry trains your brain to pick up universal patterns of energy, improving perception and connection. Fractals can amplify, distribute and focus this energy. Tune in. Turn on. One Love. ☀️
